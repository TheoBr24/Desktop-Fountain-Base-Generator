## Desktop-Fountain-Base-Generator
Python Macro for FreeCAD to create custom bases for the Modular Desktop Fountain Project.

This python script is intended to be used as a macro in FreeCAD.

The script can be used to create custom bases for the "Modular Desktop Fountain" by "3D Printy". 
The Modular Desktop Fountain can be found on Printables: https://www.printables.com/model/239774-modular-desktop-fountain

Recomended use for testing various shapes:
  <ul>
  <li>Install FreeCAD
  <li>Download the python script from this repository 
  <li>Add the file to your FreeCAD macro folder 
    <ul>
    <li>If you don't know the location of the folder, you can find it in FreeCAD: "Macro" --> "Macros" --> "User macros location" 
    <li>You can also copy the contents of the file and create a new macro in FreeCAD and paste the contents 
    </ul>
  <li>Open the file (which is already stored in the macro folder) with a texteditor like Atom, Notepad or Notepad++
   <li>Open FreeCAD --> open a new file --> "Macro" --> "Macros" --> select the macro --> macro should be executed
  <li>After you executed the macro once, you can find it under "Macro" --> "Recent macros", whith its Shortcut (something like Ctrl + Shift + 1)
   <li>Go into the texteditor (macro file is already open) and change the parameters 
   <li>Save the changes in the texteditor (usually "Strg + S" should work)
   <li>Go into FreeCAD and press the keystroke for the recently used macro (usually "Str + Shift + 1")
   <li>This should allow to quickly test various parameters (especially if you have two monitors)
   <li>There might be a better way, but thats the way I wrote and debugged the script
   </ul>
